    <P>The MCU is in a dangerous spot at the moment. Most of their new projects are flopping on release except for ones featuring previously established and loved characters. For Example 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' and 'Deadpool and Wolverine' were box office hits; yet, 'The
    Marvels', 'The Eternals', and 'Captain America: Brave New World'. The shows are the exact same with the hits being 'Loki' and 'Daredevil: Born Again'. This shows that Marvel is getting desperate. They are giving us things they know we like. That train isn't going to last forever. The Audience will get bored. After the fantastic four and the planned avengers movies they're going to need to do something big. Leading up I think marvel should be sparce with the content they are releasing. Spend time and effort into the projects they know the audience is excited for instead of trying to saturate the market. Secondly and more importantly, I beleive super hero movies are main stream enough to where the films can be treated like how the James Bond Movies are. They are all loosely connected with one another sometimes featuring the same actor in the titular role and sometimes not. I beleive Marvel is afraid of confusing the audience but we are smarter than they think.
