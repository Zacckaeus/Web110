         <h3>Favorite Characters</h3>
        <p>My favorite vanguard role to play is Penni Parker. This is due to her ability to play defensivley which is much more my play style.</p>
        <p>My favorite deulist to play at the moment is Hela but it fluctuates. Hela along with other characters in this category like staying back and again play defensively which I am good at.</p>
        <p>My favorite strategist is currently Adam Warlock. He is an off healer which means his abilities have the capacity to heal but not as well as others. He plays similarly to Hela and likes to stay back and has a game changing resurection ultimate ability which is really fun to use.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Favorite Map</h3>
        <p>My favorite map is Intergalactic Republic of Wakanda domination. Domination is by far the best game mode in the game because it allows for a comeback the most and the maps don't favor a particular side as much. Wakanda also has events that can help or harm players that activate randomly and adds a lot of fun to the map.</p>
